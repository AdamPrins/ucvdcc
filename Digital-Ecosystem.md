# Digital Ecosystem Requirements

A desired outcome of this challenge is to contribute and add to the work to benefit and move the digital ecosystem as a whole forward. It is expected that this challenge will help inform and contribute to the following.

A key goal is to align to an put into practice the concepts being developed in the **Public Sector Profile of the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework**. Documentation can be found at: https://github.com/canada-ca/pctf-ccp

Another key goal is to leverage the outcomes of the **DHS Silicon Valley Innovation Program (DHS SVIP)** which has been developing multi-platform interoperability between 7 independent platforms and 7 independent vendors.  A workshop conducted in spring 2020 has demonstrated interoperability across both multi-hop supply chain asset tracking and high value identity credential issuance and verification operational scenarios.

Following are links to repositories which the vendors should be familiar with and be prepared to contribute to.
